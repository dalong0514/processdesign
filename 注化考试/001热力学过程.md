# 热力学过程

## 热力学研究的内容
1、由PVT「状态方程」算那些不能由实验测定的热力学性质，再由热力学性质计算「第一定律」过程的热和功。

另一个角度来看，热力学研究的领域是能量的相互转化，涉及到化工过程，就是热和功的转化关系。

2、进行相平衡、化学平衡计算。

## 基本概念

1、热力学研究的作用。

摘自《ITCET》

> The chemical engineer copes with a particularly wide variety of problems using thermodynamic. Among them are calculation of heat and work requirements for physical and chemical processes, and the determination of equilibrium conditions for chemical reactions and for the transfer of chemical species between phases.

2、热力学只能解决方向和限度的问题，但不能解决途径和速率的问题。

摘自《ITCET》

> Thermodynamic considerations do not establish the rates of chemical or physical processes. Rates depend on driving force and resistance. Although driving forces are thermodynamic variables, resistances are not.


3、体系的概念。

孤立、封闭、敞开。

4、焦耳实验。

从焦耳实验的结论，热和功存在一定的定量关系；并且热是一种能量；

5、内能的变化值。

内能它没有一个明确的意义，是人为的定义，它是一个热力学概念，绝对值是不知道的，但是我们无需知道它的绝对值，只需知道它的变化值就行了。

内能人为的定义如下，摘自《ITCET》：

> There exists a form of energy, known as internal energy U, which is an intrinsic property of a system, functionally related to the measurable coordinates which characterize the system.

6、热力学第一定律的概念。

能量守恒，它是应用于系统和环境两者结合起来的整体的，即系统的能量变化加上环境的能量变化为 0。

7、封闭系统的能量守恒。

	Δ(Energy of system) = Q+W

	ΔUt=Q+W

可以说是最重要的公式，它揭示了我们最终需要的热、功与可测量的参数 PVT 之前的关系。PVT 可以计算内能的变化值，通过内能的变化值计算我们想要的热和功。

另一个角度来看，从状态 1 到状态 2，可以有很多过程「路径」来实现，每一个路径的热和功是不同的，但 Q+W 肯定是一样，也就是内能变化值是不变的，也说明了内能是一个状态变量，一个状态对应着一个特定的值。同时利用这一点，算一个实际过程的热力学性质变化时就可以用等效的思维，可以把一个实际的过程用另一个虚拟的路线代替算起功和热，只有初、终两个状态点与实际的一样。

8、热力学中平衡的概念。

不仅没有变化，还不能有变化的趋势，摘自《ITCET》：

> In thermodynamics it means not only the absence of change but the absence of any tendency toward change on a macroscopic scale.
Since any tendency toward change is caused by a driving force of one kind or another, the absence of such a tendency indicates also the absence of any driving force. Hence for a system at equilibrium all forces are in exact balance.

> Different kinds of driving forces tend to bring about different kinds of change. For example, imbalance of mechanical forces such as pressure on a piston tend to cause energy transfer as work; temperature differences tend to cause the flow of heat; gradients in chemical potential tend to cause substances to be transferred from one phase to another. At equilibrium all such forces are in balance.

> In many applications of thermodynamics, chemical reactions are of no concern. For example, a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen at ordinary conditions is not in chemical equilibrium, because of the large driving force for the formation of water. However, if chemical reaction is not initiated, this system can exist in long-term thermal and mechanical equilibrium, and purely physical processes may be analyzed without regard to possible chemical reaction. This is an example of the fact that systems existing at partial equilibrium are often amenable to thermodynamic analysis.

9、相的自由度规则。

对于非反应系统；F=2+N-π；

Where π is the number of phases, N is the number of chemical species, and F is called the
degrees of freedom of the system.

10、可逆过程以及其应用；

A process is reversible when its direction can be reversed at any point by an infinitesimal change in external conditions.
The reversible process is ideal in that it can never be fully realized; it represents a limit to the performance of actual processes. In thermodynamics, the calculation of work is usually made for reversible processes, because of their tractability to mathematical analysis. Results for reversible processes in combination with appropriate efficiencies yield reasonable approximations of the work for actual processes.
If the process produces work, the absolute value for the reversible process is too large and must be multiplied by an efficiency. If the process requires work, the value for the reversible process is too small and must be divided by an efficiency.
摘自《ITCET》

11、焓的由来；

人为定义的一个热力学性质，说白了是为了方便恒压过程的热量计算；H就等价于U+PV；

The appearance of the group U+ PV, both here and in other applications, suggests the definition for convenience of a new thermodynamic property.

摘自《ITCET》

12、恒容过程和恒压过程；

Constant-V Processes: Q=nΔU
Thus for a mechanically reversible, constant-volume, closed-system process, the heat transferred
is equal to the internal-energy change of the system.
Constant-P Processes: Q=nΔH
Thus for a mechanically reversible, constant-pressure, closed-system process, the heat transferred equals the enthalpy change of the system. The enthalpy plays a role in constant-pressure processes analogous to the internal energy in constant-volume processes.
13、临界温度的概念；
使物质由气态变为液态的最高温度叫临界温度。每种物质都有一个特定的温度，在这个温度以上，无论怎样增大压强，气态物质都不会液化，这个温度就是临界温度。
物质以液态形式出现的最高温度；高于临界温度，无论加多大压力都不能使气体液化；在临界温度时，使气体液化所必须的最低压力叫临界压力；临界温度越低，越难液化。
因此要使物质液化，首先要设法达到它自身的临界温度。有些物质如氨、二氧化碳等，它们的临界温度高于或接近室温，对这样的物质在常温下很容易压缩成液体。有些物质如氧、氮、氢、氦等的临界温度很低，其中氦气的临界温度为-268℃。要使这些气体液化，必须相应的要有一定的低温技术，以使能达到它们各自的临界温度，然后再用增大压强的方法使它液化。
降温加压，是使气体液化的条件。但只加压，不一定能使气体液化，应视当时气体是否在临界温度以下。如果气体温度超过临界温度，无论怎样增大压强，气态物质也不会液化。例如，水蒸汽的临界温度为374℃，远比常温度要高，因此，平常水蒸汽极易冷却成水。
14、真实气体和理想气体的内能与什么参数有关；
真实气体内能与温度T和压力P有关；理想气体的内能(焓也是)只与温度T有关；H=U+PV=U+RT；
We know from the phase rule that the internal energy of a real gas is a function of pressure as well as of temperature. This pressure dependency is the result of forces between the molecules. If such forces did not exist, no energy would be required to alter the average intermolecular distance, and therefore no energy would be required to bring about volume and pressure changes in a gas at constant temperature. We conclude that in the absence of molecular interactions, the internal energy of a gas depends on temperature only.
H also is a function of temperature only.

15、气体只有几公斤的话就可以当理想气体来对待；
16、理想气体的恒压热容CP和恒容热容CV的关系；
Cp=Cv+R；从热容的定义dQ/dT出发，结合第一定律基本公式还是PV=RT自己推导；
17、理想气体、机械可逆、封闭系统的热功计算公式；
和dT、dP关系公式的推导过程；
dQ+dW=dU；dU=CvdT；
那么dQ+dW=CvdT；dW=-PdV；
那么dQ=CvdT+PdV；这是Q与T、V的关系式；V=RT/P，运用微分的基本原则；
dQ=CpdT-RTdP/P;公式1；
dW=-RdT+RTdP/P；公式2；
恒温过程；公式1、2里的前一项清0；
Q=RTln(V2/V1)=-RTln(P2/P1)；
W=-RTln(V2/V1)=RTln(P2/P1)；
恒压过程；公式1、2里的后一项清0；
dQ=CpdT；
dW=-RdT；
恒容过程；W=0；
绝热过程；Q=0；
18、对于理想气体；
内能与体积V无关，dU=CvdT；焓与压力P无关，dH=CpdT；
19、热力学性质估算的思路；
thermodynamic-property evaluation is most conveniently accomplished in two steps: first, calculation of values for a hypothetical ideal-gas state wherein ideal-gas heat capacities are used; second, correction of the ideal-gas-state values to the real-gas values. A real gas becomes ideal in the limit as P--0; if it were to remain ideal when compressed to finite pressures, its state would remain that of an ideal gas. Gases in their ideal-gas states have properties that reflect their individuality just as do real gases. Ideal-gas heat capacities are therefore different for different gases; although functions of temperature, they are independent of pressure.
摘自《ITCET》
20、热和功虽然单位是一样的，焦耳，但它们还是有区别的；
功不考虑摩擦的情况下可以百分百转化为热，但反过来就不行了，转化率不会超过40%；同等量的情况下，功要比热金贵多了；
21、热力学第一定律、第二定律揭示了什么；
热力学是处理能量变化方面问题的；第一定律揭示了能量守恒；第二定律揭示了过程能量变化的方向问题，一个通俗的表象就是两个物体接触，热量总是从高温物体跑向低温物体，从来不会反方向跑；
22、热力学第二定律的概念解释；
Statement 1: No apparatus can operate in such a way that its only effect (in system and surroundings) is to convert heat absorbed by a system completely into work done by the system.
Statement 2: No process is possible which consists solely in the transfer of heat from one temperature level to a higher one.
Statement 1 does not say that heat cannot be converted into work; only that the process cannot leave both the system and its surroundings unchanged. Consider a system consisting of an ideal gas in a piston/cylinder assembly expanding reversibly at constant temperature. According to Eq. (2.3), U=Q+W. For an ideal gas, U=0, and therefore, Q = -W. The heat absorbed by the gas from the surroundings is equal to the work transferred to the surroundings by the reversible expansion of the gas. At first this might seem a contradiction of statement 1, since in the surroundings the result is the complete conversion of heat into work. However, this statement requires in addition that no change occur in the system, a requirement that is not met. This process is limited in another way, because the pressure of the gas soon reaches that of the surroundings, and expansion ceases. Therefore, the continuous production of work from heat by this method is impossible. If the original state of the system is restored in order to comply with the requirements of statement 1, energy from the surroundings in the form of work is needed to compress the gas back to its original pressure. At the same time energy as heat is transferred to the surroundings to maintain constant temperature. This reverse process requires at least the amount of work gained from the expansion; hence no net work is produced.
Evidently, statement 1 may be expressed in an alternative way, viz.:
Statement la: It is impossible by a cyclic process to convert the heat absorbed by a system completely into work done by the system.
The word cyclic requires that the system be restored periodically to its original state. In the case of a gas in a piston/cylinder assembly, its initial expansion and recompression to the original state constitute a complete cycle. If the process is repeated, it becomes a cyclic process. The restriction to a cyclic process in statement la amounts to the same limitation as that introduced by the words only effect in statement 1.
The second law does not prohibit the production of work from heat, but it does place a limit on how much of the heat directed into a cyclic process can be converted into work done by the process. With the exception of water and wind power, the partial conversion of heat into work is the basis for nearly all commercial production of power.
摘自《ITCET》
第二定律也可以理解为熵增定律，即任何自发过程均为熵增过程；详见熵的概念；
23、热机的概念；
热机是指各种利用内能做功的机械，是将燃料的化学能转化成内能再转化成机械能，如蒸汽机、汽轮机、燃气轮机、内燃机、喷气发动机等。热机通常以气体作为工质（传递能量的媒介物质叫工质），利用气体受热膨胀对外做功。热能的来源主要有燃料燃烧产生的热能、原子能、太阳能和地热等。
heat engines, devices or machines that produce work from heat in a cyclic process. An example is a steam power plant in which the working fluid (steam) periodically returns to its original state. In such a power plant the cycle (in its simplest form) consists of the following steps:
1---Liquid water at ambient temperature is pumped into a boiler at high pressure.
2---Heat from a fuel (heat of combustion of a fossil fuel or heat from a nuclear reaction) is transferred in the boiler to the water, converting it to high-temperature steam at the boiler pressure.
3---Energy is transferred as shaft work from the steam to the surroundings by a device such as a turbine, in which the steam expands to reduced pressure and temperature.
4---Exhaust steam from the turbine is condensed by transfer of heat to the surroundings, producing liquid water for return to the boiler, thus completing the cycle.
24、热机的效率；
Essential to all heat-engine cycles are absorption of heat into the system at a high temperature, rejection of heat to the surroundings at a lower temperature, and production of work.
The working fluid of a heat engine absorbs heat |QH| from a hot reservoir, produces a net amount of work |W|, discards heat |QC| to a cold reservoir, and returns to its initial state. 
效率不可能是100%的，那么最高的极限在哪？就是可逆过程的循环，也就是卡诺循环；卡诺是极限，但实际是达不到的；
卡诺热机的效率恒等于|W|/|QH|=1-Tc/Th；
这个公式看卡诺循环的PV图，2个恒温过程的热量Q公式推导出Qh/Qc=Th/Tc，然后转换成效率的计算公式；
一般实际的热机是不可逆的过程，热效率一般很少有超过35%的；
The cold reservoirs naturally available on earth are the atmosphere, lakes and rivers, and the oceans, for which Tc=300 K. Hot reservoirs are objects such as furnaces where the temperature is maintained by combustion of fossil fuels and nuclear reactors where the temperature is maintained by fission of radioactive elements. For these practical heat sources, TH=600 K.
This is a rough practical limit for the thermal efficiency of a Carnot engine; actual heat engines are irreversible, and their thermal efficiencies rarely exceed 0.35.
按上面这个数据1-300/600=0.5；再加上实际热机的过程是不可逆的；
卡诺循环的过程；
Step 1: A system at the temperature of a cold reservoir Tc undergoes a reversible adiabatic process that causes its temperature to rise to that of a hot reservoir at TH.
Step 2: The system maintains contact with the hot reservoir at TH, and undergoes a reversible isothermal process during which heat |QH| is absorbed from the hot reservoir.
Step 3: The system undergoes a reversible adiabatic process in the opposite direction of step 1 that brings its temperature back to that of the cold reservoir at Tc.
Step 4: The system maintains contact with the reservoir at Tc, and undergoes a reversible isothermal process in the opposite direction of step 2 that returns it to its initial state with rejection of heat |QC| to the cold reservoir.
自己画个PV图应该就清楚了；
网上收集的卡诺循环步骤；
等温吸热，在这个过程中系统从高温热源中吸收热量；
绝热膨胀，在这个过程中系统对环境作功，温度降低；
等温放热，在这个过程中系统向环境中放出热量，体积压缩；
绝热压缩，系统恢复原来状态，在等温压缩和绝热压缩过程中系统对环境作负功。
卡诺循环可以想象为是工作于两个恒温热源之间的准静态过程，其高温热源的温度为T1，低温热源的温度为T2。卡诺假设工作物质只与两个恒温热源交换热量，没有散热、漏气、摩擦等损耗。为使过程是准静态过程，工作物质从高温热源吸热应是无温度差的等温膨胀过程，同样，向低温热源放热应是等温压缩过程。因限制只与两热源交换热量，脱离热源后只能是绝热过程。做卡诺循环的热机叫做卡诺热机。
提高热机的效率，应努力提高高温热源的温度和降低低温热源的温度（提高T1，降低T2，减少散热、漏气、摩擦等不可逆损耗，使循环尽量接近卡诺循环），低温热源通常是周围环境，降低环境的温度难度大、成本高，是不足取的办法。现代热电厂尽量提高水蒸气的温度，使用过热蒸汽推动汽轮机，正是基于这个道理。
25、空调的制冷原理；
单级蒸汽压缩制冷系统是由制冷压缩机、冷凝器、蒸发器和节流阀四个基本部件组成。它们之间用管道依次连接，形成一个密闭的系统，制冷剂在系统中不断地循环流动，发生状态变化，与外界进行热量交换。
液体制冷剂在蒸发器中吸收被冷却的物体热量（空气，被吸收热量后变冷的空气打回室内）之后，汽化成低温低压的蒸汽，被压缩机吸入、压缩成高压高温的蒸汽后排入冷凝器，在冷凝器中向冷却介质(水或从室外抽进来的空气)放热，冷凝为高压液体，经节流阀节流为低压低温的制冷剂再次进入蒸发器吸热汽化，达到循环制冷的目的。这样，制冷剂在系统中经过蒸发、压缩、冷凝、节流四个基本过程完成一个制冷循环。
在制冷系统中，蒸发器、冷凝器、压缩机和节流阀是制冷系统中必不可少的四大件，这当中蒸发器是输送冷量的设备。制冷剂在其中吸收被冷却物体的热量实现制冷。压缩机是心脏，起着吸入、压缩、输送制冷剂蒸汽的作用。冷凝器是放出热量的设备，将蒸发器中吸收的热量连同压缩机功所转化的热量一起传递给冷却介质带走。节流阀对制冷剂起节流降压作用、同时控制和调节流入蒸发器中制冷剂液体的数量，并将系统分为高压侧和低压侧两大部分。
空调的制冷原理是空调在通电后，制冷系统内制冷剂的低压蒸汽被压缩机吸入并压缩为高压蒸汽后排至冷凝器，同时轴流风扇吸入的室外空气流经冷凝器，带走制冷剂放出的热量，使高压制冷剂蒸汽凝结为高压液体，高压液体经过过滤器、节流机构后喷入蒸发器，并在相应的低压下蒸发，吸取周围的热量。同时贯流风扇使空气不断进入蒸发器的肋片间进行热交换，并将放热后变冷的空气送向室内，这样使室内的空气不断地循环，从而到达降低温度的作用；
26、熵的概念及由来；
首先要清楚，熵是由卡诺循环里衍生出来的；这只是一个角度，从热机的角度来解读熵的概念，也可以从量子力学和统计学的角度来解读；
卡诺循环的一个基本公式|Qh|/Th=|Qc|/Tc；由于Qh是吸收的热量、正直，Qc是放出的热量、负的，那么就得到公式Qh/Th+Qc/Tc=0；
Thus for a complete cycle of a Carnot engine, the two quantities Q/T associated with the absorption and rejection of heat by the working fluid of the engine sum to zero. The working fluid of a cyclic engine periodically returns to its initial state, and its properties, e.g., temperature, pressure, and internal energy, return to their initial values. Indeed, a primary characteristic of a property is that the sum of its changes is zero for any complete cycle. Thus for a Carnot cycle Eq. (5.9) suggests the existence of a property whose changes are given by the quantities Q/ T.
那么Q/ T就应该是某一种热力学性质；认为定义为熵；
画一个PV图，对于任意一个可逆的循环过程，可以看出是无数个小卡诺循环组成的；
Thus the quantities d Qrev/ T sum to zero for the arbitrary cycle, exhibiting the characteristic of a property. We therefore infer the existence of a property whose differential changes for the arbitrary cycle are given by these quantities. The property is called entropy.
基本公式是dS=dQrev/ T；公式5.11；
焓变是一个状态函数，只与初始状态有关，与路径无关；
可逆、绝热过程是等熵过程，即熵变为0；
Entropy owes its existence to the second law, from which it arises in much the same way as internal energy does from the first law. Equation (5.11) is the ultimate source of all equations that relate the entropy to measurable quantities. It does not represent a definition of entropy; there is none in the context of classical thermodynamics. What it provides is the means for calculating changes in this property. Its essential nature is summarized by the following axiom:
There exists a property called entropy S, which is an intrinsic property of a system, functionally related to the measurable coordinates which characterize the system. For a reversible process, changes in this property are given by Eq. (5.11).
27、理想气体的熵变计算公式及推导；
详见蓝皮指南书的P28或者《ITCET》的P166的公式5.14；
蓝皮书习题提炼；
1、热量、体积、熵、功里面，体积和熵是状态函数；
2、理想气体自由膨胀等价于对真空膨胀，W为0；
